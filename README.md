# freeSpaceTracking <br>
A Qt application used for tracking in a free space quantum key-distribution experiment, automating the interactions between a Baumer VGL-22M camera and a PI systems hexapod platform. The application additionally features the options of doing on the fly atmospheric seeing measurements.

## Getting started: (linux) <br>

qt5:<br>
sudo apt-get install build-essential <br>
get latest qt5 distro from qhttps://www.qt.io/download <br>

opencv2: <br>
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev <br>

Additionally, software libraries from Baumer and PI Systems must be included in the src directory.
